# Tactical and match information extraction through football matches frames

## Abstract

Nowadays, football tactics are developed with sofisticated and innovative techniques more often. Alongside with this scenario, there are several ways to reach out better results on the pitch for a professional team: improve physical tests, study opponents in-match patterns, review mistakes and flaws from past fixtures, amongst many other activities. The technological enhancements in these tasks is currently being led by integrating a different knowledge area: data analysis. This project has the main goal of exploring image datasets composed by match situations frames, provided by an open-source dataset [1], and extract key indicators from the match events displayed, such as tactical disposition, attack or defence scenarios and identification of possible goal situations.
