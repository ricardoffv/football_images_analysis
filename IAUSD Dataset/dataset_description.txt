The dataset selected for this project is a fragment of the dataset made available by a research provided 
by the IET (Institute of Engineering and Technology). 

The original dataset contains several images of in-match events taken from frames of TV transmission of the fixtures. 
The situations portrayed as samples can be several: frre-kick angle, card showed by refferee to a player, goal 
celebrations, amongst many others.

This study has interest only in wide pictures of players distributed through the pitch. Due to that, the complete 
dataset of the study were refined to mantain only images where tactical information could be potentially extracted, 
i.e., the dataset used has only images of wide range taken when the ball was inside the pitch and a significant amount 
of players is shown.
